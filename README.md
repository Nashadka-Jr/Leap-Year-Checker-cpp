This was a suggested project to learn about logic. Unfortunately, it was not as simple as I first thought.
A leap year is a year that is divisible by 4, unless it is divisible by 100 but not 400. For instance, 2000 is a leap year, but 2300 is not.
In order to check divisibility, I decided to take advantage of the differences between integer variables and double variables.
For every operation that had to be done, I set a double equal to the math, an integer equal to the double, and finally a double equal to the integer.
Some side effects include:
  1. The input is a double, which shouldn't be allowed
  2. I have a massive number of variables with questionable naming
  3. Looking at my own code gives me a headache.

However, it is finally over. The only thing I'm not sure about is whether it is accurate for years later than 9999 or years less than 1000. But the program follows the same logic regardless.
Just download the .cpp file or copy it to your own text editor and compile it.
